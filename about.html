        <h2>About Alice</h2>

        <p>My name is Alice, and as far back as I can remember I have been a sufferer of sleep disorder and anxiety. As a child at night I would travel to a far away place where anything was possible. I called this place “Wonderland”. Here I encountered
            various stressful and also enlightening situations which would always begin with funny as it may sound chasing a rabbit! I would then slip down a tunnel into “Wonderland” where I would face my fears head on while meeting exillerating characters
            each night. It was only in my twenties when I sought help for my issues that I realised that this was my anxiety manifesting itself. Through various processes and experiences, I have now learned to control this anxiety. I have found happiness
            in pursuing my passion which is giving others the gift of freedom and happiness. Through the creation of my immersive wellness retreat experience my team are able to touch and change the lives of so many other sufferers. </p>
